# Discord-Voice-Message-Rickroll
Allows you to send a rickroll voice message on any platform!

Requires an account token to work. You or someone you trust should carefully review the script before entering your account token.

Windows users: To use this without having to install python first, [go to the releases tab](https://github.com/CoC-Fire/Discord-Voice-Message-Rickroll/releases) and download either the single file executable or the bundled executable. For most use cases, the single file executable is best.
